# @deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app

## Summary

The Desktop Host loads `dsh-web-app` after `dsh-base`. This bundle supplies authenticated local frontend transport, Client modules, and per-Session Agent presets. The Electron window consumes those assets; users configure the installed app through its Desktop profile.

## Use this package

The Desktop profile includes this bundle. Configure optional providers in `~/.merforge/profiles/desktop/cordis.patch.yml` (or under `MERFORGE_HOME`) and use [Desktop setup](../../../apps/desktop/README.md) for the provider prerequisites. The generated [configuration catalog](../../../docs/config-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-web-app) lists this bundle's fields.

## Understand the implementation

The bundle is one patch layer of three files plus one runtime glue plugin: `cordis.patch.yml` carries the host rows and the preset registry, and each `presets/<id>.patch.yml` inserts one shipped preset declaration, applied in the order `dsh.bundle.patch` lists them. The storage stack and projection cache come from `dsh-base`; the web overlay's workspace and message-feedback rows consume that shared `storageDomain` service. The patch restates the surface-specific values the base deliberately omits, inserts the web-only host rows and browser roster, then moves the agent plane behind presets. The glue plugin owns dist serving, trust sampling, prompt sections, the bash variable, and the readiness announcements.

### Patch semantics

A patch replaces the targeted row's whole `config`, so each web row restates every key it owns: the persona prefix and suffix templates, the `session-query-sqlite` values on the base rows, then `insert` adds the web host rows, transport, and browser roster. The per-agent tool rows the base mounts process-wide are disabled here and the preset roster takes over; the reasoning for each host-plane versus preset-plane decision is inline in the patch.

### Readiness

The URL line and browser handoff are readiness signals: supervisors RPC as soon as they observe the line, and a browser requests the page as soon as it opens, so both run only after the Loader tree settles, the required-startup audit passes, and Connection authentication is available — or immediately in a hand-built tree without a Loader. Client combo JavaScript and source maps remain unmaterialized at this point. Optional plugin failures do not suppress readiness; a required startup failure or a tree disposed mid-boot announces nothing.

### LAN trust sampling

`resolveLanTrust` samples the network once at boot: a loopback bind (`127.0.0.1`) derives no LAN addresses, while an all-interfaces bind adds every non-internal IPv4 literal. The derived literals plus the explicit `--trusted-host` authorities form the `/api` browser-trust fence, and the printed LAN URL always matches that fence.

### Source map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) | The `web-app` glue plugin: dist resolution, LAN trust sampling, prompt sections, bash variable, URL line, browser handoff |
| [`src/startup.ts`](src/startup.ts) | The `web-startup` provider: `--host`, `--port`, `--trusted-host`, `--no-open`, `--help` |
| [`cordis.patch.yml`](cordis.patch.yml) | The web patch: restated base values, web host rows, browser roster, preset registry |
| [`presets/`](presets) | One `@deepseek-ai/dsh-agent-preset` declaration per shipped preset (`standard`, `minimal`), each its own patch file |
| — | No runtime invariant companion is published; every contribution (frontend-static child plugin, prompt section, bashEnv registration) is registry-disposed with the fiber, and each owning registry's package carries that relation's invariant; the package holds no mutable state of its own to audit. |
| [`tests/web-app.spec.ts`](tests/web-app.spec.ts) | Dist resolution, fallback seat, prompt sections, readiness |
| [`tests/startup.spec.ts`](tests/startup.spec.ts) | Command-line parsing over a real Loader tree |
| [`tests/trusted-hosts.spec.ts`](tests/trusted-hosts.spec.ts) | LAN-trust sampling |
| [`tests/browser-open.spec.ts`](tests/browser-open.spec.ts) | Default-browser handoff after the page is reachable |

### Invariant ownership

No invariant companion is published because every contribution — the frontend-static child plugin, the prompt sections, and the bash variable registration — is registry-disposed with the fiber, and each owning registry package carries that relation's invariant.

## Model Experience

### Harness-source and Web-surface context

#### What the model sees

When `surfaceContext` is true, the `harness:source` section identifies the on-disk Harness implementation without claiming it is the working directory, and the `app:web-surface` global section (first-party order 10100, after reusable instructions) orients the model to the GUI: the canonical local URL, the "this page" referent, and the instruction not to start replacement servers. `DSH_WEB_URL` additionally appears in the managed bash environment with its description, resolved per invocation from the live server. When it is false, neither section nor the variable is registered.

#### Token effect

One source line and one prompt paragraph per session plus two managed-environment variable lines; constant per process.

#### KV Cache effect

Source and Web sections follow first-party reusable instructions. Different checkout paths or local ports leave that preceding prefix unchanged when tools and configuration match; provider cache reuse is not guaranteed.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits tell you what to expect in unusual setups — a source checkout, SSH sessions, or strict networks. They are current package constraints, not a general browser comparison or a task backlog.

- **The frontend must be built** — a source checkout needs `pnpm run build` first; startup stops with a build hint when the dist is missing, and there is no source-serving fallback.
- **LAN addresses are sampled once at startup** — interface changes after boot are not re-advertised; the printed LAN URL always matches what was sampled.
- **Only the handoff start is observable** — the GUI reports that the browser was asked to open, not that it actually opened; a later browser exit is never reported, and the printed URL is your manual fallback.
- **SSH sessions keep the URL but skip the browser handoff** — the printed URL names the remote host's loopback endpoint; the SSH client or editor must expose and open the local forwarded address.
- **`BROWSER` overrides only come from the environment** — a discovered `.env` cannot set `BROWSER`; only an inherited value can choose the executable for the automatic handoff.
- **Binding all network interfaces is not supported** — `--host 0.0.0.0` is rejected at startup for safety; use the default loopback host.

None.

The Web composition owns transport and settings; the official services bundle adds the account Remote controller and Account settings section for public profiles.
