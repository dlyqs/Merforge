  intro: 'Every repository-declared durable Session event appears here with its source declaration and resolved types. The catalog covers the logical and physical headers, event envelopes, and every plugin declaration merge. See [Session](subsystems/session.md) for replay and [persistence](subsystems/persistence.md) for storage.',
  generation: 'Run `pnpm run gen-persistence-catalog` to regenerate the English catalog, the known-event module, and the machine schema inventory. `pnpm run verify-persistence-catalog` checks all generated files. Declaration fences preserve source JSDoc and type references; resolved definitions expose their transitive structure.',
  envelopeIntro: 'The envelope carries `type`, `seq`, `time`, `data`, optional `ignorable`, and conditional `surfaceOp` / `sourceEventSeqs`. A **surface** event produces model history; a **log-only** event does not. The inventory covers this repository; external plugin types require their own declarations and are outside this catalog.',

  fingerprintsIntro: 'The [machine inventory](persistence-schema.json) contains every reachable normalized type and its SHA-256 digest. Root digests include referenced types. Comments, source locations, alias names, erased brands, readonly markers, and harmless field, union, or intersection reordering do not affect these fingerprints. Tuple order, property names, value types, and optionality do. Catalog text and source locations can still produce a diff when digests stay unchanged.',
