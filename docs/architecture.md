# DeepSeek Harness Architecture

Read this before changing anything under `packages/`. It assumes you know Cordis; if you do not, start with the [primer](cordis-primer.md) or the [tutorial](cordis-tutorial/index.md).

We recommend using an agent to explore the codebase and understand its architecture.

## Cordis

[Cordis](cordis-primer.md) is the framework under dsh: plugins contribute services, typed events, and reversible effects to a shared context. Every part of the product is a plugin, including the model adapter, the tool registry, the session log, and the agent loop itself, so each is replaceable from configuration.

There is no privileged core to patch: you extend dsh by mounting a plugin beside the others, and registrations are effects that unwind when their plugin unloads.

## Profiles and bundles

A running Desktop Host is a plugin tree composed at boot from ordered layers.

A **profile** is a named composition stored in the Merforge home. It lists its bundles, holds any out-of-tree plugins, and keeps the user's `cordis.patch.yml`. Desktop ships one `desktop` profile template.

A **bundle** is a distribution format for Cordis config rows and the code they mount, so whatever it inserts stays patchable by the layers above it.

Each declares itself in its own `package.json` under a `dsh` field: `dsh.profile` lists a profile's bundles, and `dsh.bundle` points at a bundle's patch file.

[`dsh-base`](../packages/bundle/base/README.md) supplies model adapters, tools, persistence, permissions, settings, and credentials. [`dsh-web-app`](../packages/bundle/web-app/README.md) supplies the internal Client application. The [Desktop Host patch](desktop-composition.md) adds product restrictions and optional browser and computer-use providers.

Layers apply to an empty entry list in this order: each bundle in the profile's listed order, then the profile's `cordis.patch.yml`, then the home-level patch, then the Desktop Host patch. A patch targets a row by id and replaces its whole config, or inserts new rows.

YAML controls config-only `dsh-hmr`. The Desktop Host provides profile data and readiness while the Host owns process startup and shutdown.

The profile and home patches can replace rows or add plugins; the Desktop Host patch applies product-owned restrictions afterward.

Composition mechanics are in [app-boot](../packages/boot/app-boot/README.md#profiles); config fields are in the generated [config catalog](config-catalog.md).

## Application launch

The Electron shell launches the private Desktop Host through its internal profile boot API. The Host loads the `desktop` profile and serves the Client through authenticated loopback transport. No public Node application launcher or protocol server ships. Electron can explicitly start a separate private organization process (`apps/desktop-host/lib/organization.js`) over parent IPC. Its dedicated `organization.yml` loads only the organization authority and restricted HTTPS API; it never loads the personal profile. The service defaults to disabled, has no standalone launcher or bin, and stops when Electron exits or parent IPC disconnects. The native `organization-connection` owner supplies fixed, top-frame-only preload operations to `ui-organization`; the personal Host does not proxy LAN routes. Explicit settings may restore the service on application startup. Stopped-service backup/restore uses the same exclusive directory lock as service boot. The [organization design](organization-foundation.md) owns TLS, account isolation and maintenance.

Vendored CLIs, build-only and test-only executables, and the private browser WebWorker preview are outside the product launch path. [`verify-application-entrypoints`](../scripts/verify-application-entrypoints.ts) rejects unsupported application entries.

## Desktop application

The [Electron desktop application](../apps/desktop/README.md) carries its production runtime in signed resources and owns `profiles/desktop` under the Merforge home (`~/.merforge` or `MERFORGE_HOME`). Shared profile helpers initialize files and resolve dependencies without replacing pnpm-owned packages. The legacy Harness home remains untouched.

Electron starts the private Desktop Host in Electron Node mode. The Host boots its profile through app-boot and the internal Web application. The window loads packaged Web assets and activates client plugins after boot injection. Web owns RPC and streams; the desktop carrier connects the page to the authenticated Host. Node IPC carries boot injection, readiness, errors, and shutdown. Profile configuration can override the default port `19387`. Desktop omits Platform account IPC, default Session upload, Office conversion, and the plugin marketplace; Desktop Host roots the packaged dependency closure. The Browser sidebar keeps Electron guests, while Agent browser and computer-use providers are present in the closure as disabled profile entries until the user enables them under their browser and OS permission prerequisites.

## Core packages

Here are some core packages that contribute to the Cordis tree.

| Package | Owns | `ctx` key |
|---|---|---|
| [`core/session`](subsystems/session.md) | The append-only `SessionEvent` log and in-memory store | `ctx.sessions` |
| [`core/system-prompt`](subsystems/system-prompt.md) | Prompt-section and tool-schema assembly | `ctx.systemPrompt` |
| [`core/tools`](subsystems/tools.md) | The scoped tool registry and guarded execution pipeline | `ctx.tools` |
| [`core/agent`](subsystems/core.md) | The `Agent` interface, live registry, and `agent/*` events | `ctx.agents` |
| [`core/agent-loop`](subsystems/core.md) | The default driver implementing that interface | `ctx.agentLoop` |
| [`core/scope`](subsystems/scope.md) | The per-agent scoped-registration primitive | library, no key |
| [`llm/llm`](subsystems/llm-streaming.md) | Message and stream vocabulary plus the adapter seam | `ctx.llm` |
| [`webhook/webhook`](subsystems/webhook.md) | Authenticated-delivery dispatch and Workspace Session creation | `ctx.webhookRuntime` |

## Events

Events are the extension points, and picking the right domain is the first decision in most changes.

- **Session events** are durable facts appended to the log and broadcast through `session/event`. Use one when the fact must survive a reload.
- **Agent events** (`agent/*`) carry a live `Agent`: inbox, step, status, request, validation, continuation. Use one to observe or intercept work in flight.
- **Capability events** attach policy and adapters to a seam (`fs/*`, `tools/*`, `telemetry/*`) without importing the loop.

AgentLoop awaits serial `agent/created` initialization before starting queued work. Initialization failure rolls back creation; [agent-loop](../packages/core/agent-loop/README.md#understand-the-implementation) defines teardown ordering.

The [event map](event-producer-consumer.md) lists every event's producers and consumers.

## Turn flow

A **step** is one model request plus the tools it calls. A **turn** is zero or more steps: it opens before its first input is claimed and closes once nothing is owed.

```text
turn/start
  claim next-step input plus one queued message
  assemble prompt sections + tool schemas; project runtime context
  -> agent/pre-step                   reject | enter(messages, startsRequestSeries?)
     reject, or a first enter rewritten empty -> close the turn with no step
     step/start
     agent/request -> prepareCall (cancellation commits neither system nor users)
     reconcile system/message using the prepared call capability
     append entered messages as user/message; log request/header and request/context as needed
     derive and freeze model history from the log
     stream the bound prepared call -> llm/stream -> agent/assistant-stream start
       agent/assistant-stream chunk*
       assistant/message | assistant/attempt -> agent/assistant-stream end
     tool/call* -> tools/pre-execute -> tools/execute -> tools/post-execute -> tool/result*
     step/end
     tools owe another request, or next-step input arrived -> claim -> next step
  -> agent/turn-stopping
turn/end
```

`turn/*`, `step/*`, `system/message`, `user/message`, `assistant/message`, `assistant/attempt`, and `tool/*` are durable session events; the rest are live extension points across three domains. `agent/assistant-stream` publishes process-local start, transient chunk, and end frames. The loop commits the complete compact stream as one message or log-only attempt before a committed end frame, and the Web Session-follow adapter is the live event's only remote consumer. `agent/pre-step`, `agent/request`, `llm/stream`, and the three `tools/*` events are waterfalls, whose listeners must call `next()` to delegate; `agent/turn-stopping` is serial and has no `next()`.

One inbox feeds the driver; injected context waits for a waking message. AgentLoop’s durable `inbox` projection exposes pending input without live Agents.

`agent/pre-step` decides the accepted input. Listeners may rewrite or reject claimed messages; a rejected or empty first claim closes a durable turn without a step. An enter decision may set `startsRequestSeries`: the loop logs a fresh `request/header` (reason `series`, or `change` with `startsSeries: true` when the envelope also changed). Wrapping listeners preserve that declaration with `{ ...decision, messages }`. After assembly and `step/start`, `agent/request` and `prepareCall()` resolve the actual route before the system prompt and accepted users are committed; cancellation during either async phase commits neither. The prepared call capability governs prompt admission, not the preceding `request/context`. Every attempt synchronously reconciles the same rendered assembly, appends users only on the first attempt, logs header/context as needed, and derives and freezes the request before streaming the bound call. Retries do not repeat assembly or `agent/pre-step`. Surface replacements and image-offload decisions after attachment start a new request series, including during the first resumed pre-step; unchanged resume continues the series. The first admitted step reserves the system head before user messages even for an empty prompt (no wire message). The prompt travels only as `system/message` history: an empty rendering clears all active system nodes, leaving no old prompt model-visible; capable routes can append non-empty updates after the cached prefix; incapable routes and new request series consolidate non-empty prompt text at the first system node, with logged empty replacements for non-empty later system nodes ([decision](../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-02-system-prompt-as-surface-node.md); [decision rule](../packages/core/agent-loop/README.md#understand-the-implementation)).

The loop sends immutable requests while keeping cancellation live. It reuses message-freeze evidence only for identities it has fully frozen; [agent-loop](../packages/core/agent-loop/README.md) owns the request construction and cancellation-cause rules.

Details: the [sequence diagram](agent-lifecycle.md), the [tool pipeline](tool-execution-pipeline.md), and [cancellation and error recovery](subsystems/core.md#the-agent-handle).

## Session log

The session log is the source of the context the model sees. `deriveMessages()` projects model history from it. Each `assistant/message` embeds the exact compact timed stream that produced its assembled content; `assistant/attempt` retains settled failed, retried, cancelled, and stream-error attempts without adding model history. Fork, resume, transcripts, telemetry, and persistence all derive from these durable settlements, while live UI incrementality comes from `agent/assistant-stream`; a hard process loss before settlement leaves no durable attempt stream ([decision](../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-01-v2-embedded-assistant-streams.md)).

Session consumers read and write the current logical format. Header-only `stat` and `list` select the highest canonical generation in each Session directory without loading events. A stored-session `open` selects that generation, validates its current-version header and events, and refuses another format version. The JSONL provider owns framing, compression, generation selection, stable reads, and durable append. Ordinary repair of an unsealed interrupted tail remains a handle consumer responsibility.

**Model-visible means logged.** Anything that reaches a model request must be reconstructable from the log, and a runtime invariant asserts it. A new model-visible input requires a session event. Plugins that change existing message content register [pure message projections](subsystems/session.md#plugin-owned-message-projections); detached readers supply the same definitions explicitly.

**Projection seam.** `dsh-session-projection` owns `ctx.sessionProjections`: registered units fold committed events incrementally, host consumers read one typed state with `stateOf()`, and carriers batch cropped client views with `snapshot()`. A host reader either requires this service during activation or fails explicitly when the registry or required key is absent. Contributors may retain `ctx.inject(['sessionProjections'], ...)` registration without silently defaulting a missing host value. The agent loop registers shared `turnBoundary` state for its readers ([decision](../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-19-session-projection-mandatory-seam.md)).

## Capability seams

A **seam** is a swappable capability with three roles: a **Service Definition** declaring the interface, a **Service Provider** implementing it, and a **Consumer** using it, commonly a model-facing tool. A package may combine roles, but one role alone is not a seam; adding a capability means designing all three ([capability graph](capability-seams.md)).

Seams are why one provider swap changes the whole product. Filesystem and subprocess providers share one execution world, so pointing them at a remote sandbox moves Bash, PTY, and LSP with them, with no provider forks. [Subagent providers](subsystems/subagent.md) vary just as widely behind one interface, from a fresh child agent to a delegated turn in another product.

[Experimental Agent Teams](subsystems/agent-team.md) is a published opt-in coordination seam on `ctx.agentTeams`, with a durable roster, task board, and mailbox layered over continuable subagents.

## Where new behavior goes

New behavior attaches to a documented extension point. Changing the loop itself updates this map.

| Goal | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Add a model provider | register its adapter on `ctx.llm` |
| Add a model-facing capability | register on `ctx.tools`; its schema joins prompt assembly |
| Give one session a different capability set | compose an agent preset; a service row there needs an `isolate` realm |
| Add shell execution | register a `ctx.shell` backend; the local one spawns through `ctx.subprocess` |
| Add persistent terminal execution | register a `ctx.terminals` backend plus `dsh-tool-terminal` |
| Add a human command | register on `ctx.commands`; it dispatches without a model turn |
| Manage background jobs | register on `ctx.jobs`; `job_*` tools read or stop jobs |
| Start a Session from an external webhook | register a trusted rule on `ctx.webhookRuntime` and mount a provider adapter |
| Add filesystem access or policy | register a `ctx.fs` provider or listen to `fs/*` events |
| Confine spawned processes | use a `ctx.sandbox` backend; consumers wrap argv before spawning |
| Intercept a request, tool, or turn | use its `agent/*` or `tools/*` event; `agent/turn-stopping` stops a turn |
| Add model-facing context | call `agent.inject()`; it lands in the next admitted request |
| Add UI or editor integration | drive `ctx.agents` and render from `session/event` |
| Add a Web Client Chat node | register a `ConversationNodeDefinition` + keyed renderer |
| Add durable session state | extend `SessionEventMap`; render and replay from the log |
| Generate session titles | register the sole `ctx.sessionTitle` provider |
| Fork a session at a turn boundary | `ctx.agents.create({ sessionId, seed, meta: { parentSession, seedLength } })` — only agent-loop-published sessions persist |
| Store sessions in a new backend | implement `SessionPersistence` (`create`/`open`/`stat`/`list`/`export`) over the shared handle scaffolding |
| Scope a registration to one agent | use that agent's `agent.ctx` |
