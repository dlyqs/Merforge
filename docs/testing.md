# Testing policy

How this repo tests, tier by tier, and the rules that keep a green suite meaningful. Commands live in root [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md); linked Agent Notes carry the rationale.

## Tiers

- **Unit** (`pnpm run test`): vitest over package and example specs under their `tests/**` directories plus repository script specs under `scripts/**/*.spec.ts`; tests stay with the code area they exercise. Every registry gets an HMR-safety test (dispose the contributing fiber, assert cleanup). Prefer edge cases, error paths, event ordering, concurrency races, and permanent tests for contract regressions (see `packages/core/agent-loop/tests/contract-regressions.spec.ts`).
- **Coverage** (`pnpm run test:coverage`): optional repository-wide coverage check. It retains the existing per-file threshold, but ordinary application changes use focused tests instead. A real `pwsh` is needed to cover `packages/shell/pwsh-local/src`; without one its executor suites self-skip and `vitest.config.ts` exempts the file.
- **Real-API e2e** (`pnpm run test:e2e`): with-key tests against live provider APIs — the DeepSeek model plus provider-specific smokes that gate on their own keys (`EXA_API_KEY`, `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY`, …); each suite self-skips without its key so keyless CI stays green ([real-API e2e Agent Note](../.agents/notes/implemented/testing/2026-06-19-real-api-e2e-ci.md)).



## How specs execute

Forked workers can run several spec files at once. Only the process is isolated: ports, predictable paths, external namespaces, and inherited children are not. Own each acquired resource through its teardown, and read a spec that passes only when it runs alone as a defect in the spec rather than an unstable runner.

## The with-key policy: inference is cheap here

We are DeepSeek — do not ration real-API tests. A no-key test proves plumbing; only a with-key run proves the agent works against a real model. Cover file-writing prompts, multi-turn conversations, tool use, and mid-stream cancellation. Highest-value are **smoke tests** that boot the shipped Desktop Host composition, send one prompt, and check the world — they catch the "green unit tests, broken product" class that mocks cannot ([postmortem 0001](postmortem/0001-acp-default-export-drops-inject.md)). Self-skip keeps secretless CI and keyless contributors unblocked; it is not a cost signal. Desktop integration tests live under `apps/desktop-host/tests/`; package-specific compositions stay with their package tests.

## Prefer the real implementation over a mock

Mock only the expensive or non-deterministic boundary (LLM adapter, network, clock); keep everything downstream real. A hand-rolled stand-in proves the bridge moves bytes, not that the shipping tool behaves as asserted. Bridge tool-call tests keep the real tool registry and pipeline behind the scripted mock model: `makeBridgeHarness()` mounts the loop, session store, tool registry, and JSONL persistence with a `MockAdapter` as the only mock (packages/acp/acp/tests/harness.ts).

Recovery tests separate pre/post-chunk failures by step and prove failed chunks derive no message or tool side effect. Cover exhaustion, cancellation, policy composition, persistence, status, wire counts, transport-closing idle timeouts, and shipping Loader composition.

## Verify the world, not the self-report

An e2e assertion re-runs the command or re-reads the file externally; a keyword probe on the agent's own output lets a cheating agent pass. Assert untouched files are byte-identical. e2e tests own their resources: create it in the test, dispose in `afterEach` (even on failure/retry/timeout); shared fixtures live in a plain `tests/harness.ts`, never another `*.e2e.ts` (importing a spec re-registers its `describe` and duplicates real API calls).

## Test the real entry path

- Product-visible plugins require a non-unit REAL-composition test. Hand-built `ctx.plugin(...)` suites are insufficient: boot test-only `cordis.yml` through Loader and app/process, mock only external services or nondeterministic inputs, and assert model-visible request/log, durable state, or user-visible output. Keep opt-ins out of shipped defaults.
- A guard only guards if the regression fails it. For a plugin without `inject` (bundle/composition plugins), a Loader smoke stays green when a default export replaces the required named exports — add an explicit `expect('default' in mod).toBe(false)` plus an `unwrapExports` round-trip assertion, and prove it: introduce the regression, watch red, revert.
- "Real entry path" means the published artifact: a package `bin` runs built `lib/bin.js` under plain `node`, exposing failures tsx masks (settle races, module resolution, swallowed load failures). The same applies to non-index runtime entries (the Node program bootstrap `lib/process.js`) and singleton modules shared across bundles (`packages/sdk/server/tests/built-scope-carrier.e2e.ts`). Keep the built-artifact smokes green (`packages/examples/*/tests/built-bin.e2e.ts`, `packages/ptc-runtime/ptc-runtime-node/tests/built-lib.e2e.ts`), and assert a genuinely-missing config exits non-zero.

## Test resolution: source plane only

- Every vitest config points vite-tsconfig-paths at `tsconfig.base.json`; bare workspace imports resolve to `src` ([layout](development.md#typescript-project-layout)), never through package `exports` to built `lib/` — stale artifacts there load a second copy of module singletons. Built artifacts are consumed only explicitly: `lib`-mode subprocesses and the built smokes below.

## Test subprocess launch modes

- CI and build-having test lanes run every profile or Cordis-config subprocess from built `lib/` through the shared dual-mode launcher. Do not hand-write `--import tsx` for these subprocesses.
- Protocol and operating-system fixtures that do not load Cordis run erasable `.ts` directly with Node, without tsx or the root paths map.
- Only a test whose subject is source-path resolution may select `src`; state that contract in the test.
