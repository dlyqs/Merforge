# Session format status

## Current writer

`SESSION_FORMAT_VERSION` in [core Session types](../packages/core/session/src/types.ts) identifies the format written by this checkout. The [persistence catalog](persistence-catalog.md) and [machine schema](persistence-schema.json) describe its declared header and events.

The Desktop application creates and reopens Sessions written in the current format. A file with a different format version is refused. Existing Session generations are never rewritten or deleted automatically.

When changing the current format, update the writer, reader, catalog, and affected consumers together.
